Subject: TFP M404K Post-Translational Modification Analysis - OSPREY Results

Dear [Collaborator Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share the computational results from our OSPREY analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the TFP M404K mutant at position B781 (K404).

BACKGROUND
----------
We investigated two non-enzymatic PTMs that occur on lysine residues in mitochondria:
- N6-acetyl-lysine (ALY): Acetylation at the ε-amino group
- N6-succinyl-lysine (SLL): Succinylation at the ε-amino group

Both modifications neutralize the positive charge of lysine but differ significantly in size and chemical properties.

COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
--------------------
- Software: OSPREY 3.3 with PAStE algorithm (Partition function-based Algorithm for Sampling and Testing Ensembles)
- Template geometry: Based on PDB Chemical Component Dictionary (ALY.cif, SLL.cif)
- Force field: AMBER with continuous sidechain optimization
- Epsilon: 0.1 (energy precision)
- Structure: TFP protein (PDB 6DV2), position B781

RESULTS
-------
The PAStE algorithm computed ΔΔG values for stability changes upon PTM:

1. **Acetylation (ALY)**
   - PAStE ΔΔG: +2.88 kcal/mol
   - 95% confidence interval: [-1.07, +2.97] kcal/mol
   - **Interpretation: Effect on stability UNCLEAR**
   - The confidence interval crosses zero, indicating we cannot definitively determine whether acetylation stabilizes or destabilizes the protein

2. **Succinylation (SLL)**
   - PAStE ΔΔG: +25.61 kcal/mol
   - 95% confidence interval: [+0.001, +25.70] kcal/mol
   - **Interpretation: Mutation DECREASES stability**
   - Highly unfavorable modification (positive ΔΔG indicates destabilization)
   - **IMPORTANT NOTE**: This value is unusually large and triggered a "NoWindowOverlap" warning, suggesting potential issues:
     * The succinyl template may have incorrect protonation state (should be -COO⁻ at physiological pH)
     * Possible steric clashes that need structural inspection
     * This result should be validated with refined parameters before drawing strong conclusions

BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION
-------------------------
1. **Acetylation**: The effect is marginal and statistically uncertain. This suggests that simple charge neutralization at position 404 may not significantly impact TFP stability. The small, compact acetyl group (-COCH3) appears to be tolerated.

2. **Succinylation**: This modification appears highly destabilizing (+25.6 kcal/mol), BUT this value is likely overestimated due to:
   - **Protonation state issue**: The current template uses a neutral carboxyl group (-COOH), but at pH 7.4 it should be deprotonated (-COO⁻). This incorrect charge distribution may artificially inflate the destabilization energy.
   - **Steric effects**: The bulkier succinyl group (-COCH2CH2COO⁻) may genuinely cause clashes with surrounding residues.
   - **Recommendation**: This result requires refinement with corrected protonation state before making definitive biological conclusions.

3. **Clinical relevance**: The acetylation result (+2.88 kcal/mol) is more reliable. The succinylation result needs validation, but even if the magnitude is overestimated, the direction (destabilizing) may still be correct.

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
- Templates were generated with accurate geometry from PDB Chemical Component Dictionary
- Key improvement: Amide bond NZ-C geometry corrected to 1.347 Å with 120° sp2 angles (vs. approximated 1.522 Å with 109.5° sp3 angles)
- Calculation completed in ~2 minutes on 12 CPU cores with 768 GB memory allocation
- Energy matrix was pre-computed and reused for both PTM variants

NEXT STEPS
----------
Based on these results, I would suggest:

1. **PRIORITY: Correct SLL protonation state**:
   - Update the succinyl-lysine template with deprotonated carboxyl group (-COO⁻)
   - Recalculate to get accurate ΔΔG value
   - This should bring the value into a more reasonable range

2. **Acetylation refinement**: Run with tighter epsilon (e.g., 0.01) to narrow the confidence interval and determine if there's a subtle stability effect

3. **Structural analysis**: Visualize the lowest-energy conformations to identify specific interactions:
   - Why is acetylation nearly neutral?
   - What causes succinylation destabilization (steric vs. electrostatic)?

4. **Additional positions**: Screen other lysine residues in TFP to identify which positions are most susceptible to PTMs

5. **Experimental validation**: If possible, test whether acetylation/succinylation occurs on M404K mutant in patient samples

Please let me know if you would like me to:
- Provide more detailed structural analysis
- Test additional PTM variants
- Analyze other lysine positions in the structure
- Generate figures for manuscript preparation

Best regards,
[Your Name]
